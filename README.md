# A Short Poem -> `src: chatGPT`

A quest was embarked by developers bold
To create a to-do app, sleek and old
With React, they crafted each feature well
Each component, a story to tell

Marking tasks complete, a breeze to do
Deleting them, just a click or two
React hooks, added power untold
State management, now so bold

Beta testing, the app emerged victorious
Released to the public, it became auspicious
A tool for organization and productivity
Its legend, spreading far and wide, with velocity

The developers continued to improve and update
Making the app, even more great
A true masterpiece of technology
A to-do app, for all to see.
